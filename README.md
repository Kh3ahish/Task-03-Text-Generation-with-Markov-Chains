### README.md for Markov Chain Text Generator

# **Markov Chain Text Generator**

Welcome to the **Markov Chain Text Generator** project! This Python-based implementation leverages the concept of Markov Chains to generate coherent text based on a given dataset. It supports unigram, bigram, and trigram models, offering a dynamic way to explore text generation.

---

## **Overview**

The Markov Chain Text Generator uses n-gram models to analyze text datasets and create new sequences of words that mimic the original style and structure. You can input datasets via a file or directly as text, and the program will generate unique text based on the selected n-gram size.

---

## **Features**

- Supports **unigram**, **bigram**, and **trigram** models.
- Allows flexible input: either a dataset file or direct text input.
- Customizable text generation length.
- Simple, clean, and reusable Python codebase.

## **Directory Structure**

```
MarkovChainTextGenerator/
├── README.md                 # This documentation file
├── markov_chain_generator.py # Main Python script
├── dataset.txt               # Example dataset (optional)
├── examples/
    └── generated_output.txt  # Example generated text outputs
```

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Input Dataset**: Provide a text file (`dataset.txt`) or input the text directly.
2. **Select N-gram Model**: Choose unigram (n=1), bigram (n=2), or trigram (n=3).
3. **Generate Text**: Specify the length of the generated text.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd MarkovChainTextGenerator
```

### **2. Add a Dataset**

- Place your text dataset in the `dataset.txt` file.
- Alternatively, input text directly when prompted by the script.

### **3. Run the Script**

Run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python markov_chain_generator.py
```

### **4. Follow the Prompts**

- Choose your dataset type (file or text).
- Select the n-gram size (1 for unigram, 2 for bigram, 3 for trigram).
- Specify the number of words to generate.

---

## **Example Usage**

### **Input Dataset**
```text
Once upon a time, there was a small village surrounded by hills. The villagers loved to gather and share stories by the fire.
```

### **Generated Output (Bigram Model)**
```text
Once upon a time, there was a small village surrounded by hills. The villagers loved to gather and share stories by the fire.
```

### **Example Output File**
The generated text will also be saved in `examples/generated_output.txt`.

---

## **Dependencies**

- Python 3.x

---

## **Customizations**

- **Change N-gram Size**: Modify the n-gram size dynamically during runtime (1, 2, or 3).
- **Dataset**: Replace `dataset.txt` with any text file of your choice.
